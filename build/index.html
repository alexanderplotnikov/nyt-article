                Alan Guth was one of the first physicists to hypothesize the
                existence of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded
                so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang
                13.8 billion years ago. <span>Rick Friedman for The New York Times</span>

                CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
                physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s
                appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and
                equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
                </br></br>
                He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
                particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead
                he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin
                with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic
                evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy
                that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell
                faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent
                instant. 
                </br></br>
                If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes
                like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like
                a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out
                all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not
                missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the
                ocean. 
                </br></br>
                “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top
                of the page and drew a double box around it. On Monday, Dr.
                Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they
                had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis,
                known undramatically as inflation, looked right. 
                </br></br>
                Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time
                with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by
                John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
                detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called
                gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched
                violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth
                of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought
                smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his
                colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
                </br></br>
                Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
                </br></br>
                If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
                </br></br>
                Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
                <q>‘As Big as It Gets’</q>
                
                </br></br>
                In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.  
                </br></br>
                Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
                </br></br>
                He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
                </br></br>
                The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.
                </br></br>
                Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>

                  <h2>The Theory of Inflation</h2>
                  <p>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.</p>

                    <span>THE UNIVERSE</span>  is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.

              <p>
                Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.
                </br></br>
                Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.
                </br></br>
                “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”
                </br></br>
                The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.
                </br></br>
                “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.
                </br></br>
                Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell him the news.
                </br></br>
              </p>
              <div class="videoEmbed">
                <video alt='youtube iframe'></video>
              </div>
              <p>
                Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.
                </br></br>
                “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an email.
                </br></br>
                Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.
                </br></br>
                By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
                Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”
                </br></br>
                John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,” he said.
                </br></br>
                Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he expressed reservations about inflation.
                </br></br>
                Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.
                </br></br>
                “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.
                </br></br>
                Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.
